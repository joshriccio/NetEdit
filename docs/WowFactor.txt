Our "Wow Factor" will be to implement a chat server with our software.
The chat server will be a great place for users to interact and communicate with each other.
Not only will the server be a basis for the team's communication, but it will also allow for a user to
	message a specific user.
Our goal is to have this look and act sort of like Facebook Messenger if time allows. 

Another "Wow Factor" we are highly considering if time permits, is to allow our software to handle code.
A way you can think of this, is an online interactive Notepad++. Where our software will implement popular language
	libraries, and color code the syntax accordingly.  
	
We believe that a collaborative code editor, with chat capabilities will not only deliver a jaw drop in 335,
	but allow us to continue on and make more advancements in our free time.
